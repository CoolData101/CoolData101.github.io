## Project Overview

High-end neural interfaces are often prohibitively expensive. This project democratizes access to EMG (electromyography) technology by creating an open-source, 3D-printed wristband that enables intuitive control of VR environments. By using generic, off-the-shelf components, we reduced the cost by over 90% compared to commercial alternatives—without sacrificing signal quality.

## Key Features

- **Gesture Control**: Translates muscle electrical activity into inputs for VR avatars or assistive devices.
- **Low Latency**: Sub-20ms response time ensures seamless interaction in virtual spaces.
- **Modular Design**: Fully 3D-printable enclosure with biocompatible materials.
- **Plug-and-Play**: Custom Unity plugin for easy integration with existing VR projects.

## Technical Architecture

- **Hardware**: Custom analog amplification circuit coupled with an ESP32 microcontroller.
- **Signal Processing**: Real-time filtering and feature extraction running on-device.
- **Connectivity**: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for wireless, battery-efficient communication.
- **Production**: Designed for standard FDM 3D printers using PLA/PETG.

## Impact

This project provides an affordable entry point for researchers and students interested in biosignals, while offering a practical alternative input method for users with motor disabilities who wish to engage in VR socialization.
