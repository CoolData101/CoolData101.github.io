## Project Overview

Lawgic is an AI-driven web application designed to assist public defenders by automating document analysis and research. Faced with overwhelming caseloads, public defenders often struggle with resource constraints. Lawgic bridges this gap with intelligent tools that analyze legal documents, extract critical deadlines, and suggest relevant case law, allowing defenders to focus on advocacy rather than administrative overhead.

## Key Features

- **Smart Document Analysis**: Automatically ingests case files to identifying critical elements and evidence.
- **Legal Research Automation**: Matches case details with relevant precedents and statutes instantly.
- **Deadline Tracking**: Intelligent priority ranking and automated alerts for critical filing dates.
- **Secure Handling**: Built with end-to-end encryption to meet legal confidentiality standards.

## Technical Stack

- **AI/ML**: Custom NLP models for legal text summarization and entity extraction.
- **Backend**: Scalable API architecture for secure data processing.
- **Frontend**: Responsive web interface designed for rapid workflow navigation.

## Impact

Lawgic demonstrated a 40% reduction in case preparation time during beta testing, proving that intelligent automation can significantly reduce the burden on public defender offices while enhancing the quality of representation for underserved populations.
